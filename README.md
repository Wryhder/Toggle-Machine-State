# Toggle Machine State

This is a simple little project that just aims to change the text content of a button (but it's been getting progressively sillier).

### A little background

I am [working on a clone](https://github.com/Wryhder/Simone) of the [Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) memory game. I'm using Vue, and have been trying to understand both its reactivity system and events in general. This project started as a solution to the first skill test assessment of [MDN's Introduction to events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events) article.

__PS:__ I was going to use `innerText` to grab/manipulate the button text before I read [this](https://kellegous.com/j/2013/02/27/innertext-vs-textcontent/). Check it out if you wonder how `innerText` differs from `textContent`.
